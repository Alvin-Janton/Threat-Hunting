## **Information About Incident Reports**

For this Catalyst project, I did not produce full incident reports within the `reports/` directory. Instead, each investigation in Catalyst is based directly on earlier threat-hunting projects where complete reports and detailed analyses had already been created.

If you would like to review the full investigative process, including methodology, findings, indicators, timelines, and written incident reports, you can refer to the original project folders:

### 🔍 [Threat Hunting with Python](/Threat%20Hunting%20with%20Python/README.md)
Contains the complete **S3 Data Exfiltration** investigation, including:
- Full log-analysis workflow  
- Enrichment and IOC pivoting  
- Timeline reconstruction  
- Final incident report documenting the attack  

### 🔍 [Threat Hunting with Splunk](/Threat%20Hunting%20with%20Splunk/README.md)
Contains the full **SolarWinds IOC Compromise** investigation, including:
- Dataset ingestion and validation  
- IOC lookup creation  
- Correlation of malicious outbound connections  
- Final SOC-style incident report  

These documents provide the in-depth technical analysis that informed the Catalyst incidents recreated for this project. Catalyst serves as the consolidation and documentation layer, while the full investigative reports reside in the original threat-hunting project directories.
